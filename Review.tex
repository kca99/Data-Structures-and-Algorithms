\section{Preface}
This review package/compilation/set or whatever you wish to call it is a way for me, Kevin to review for my coming semesters of computing science courses. These are the fundamentals of which I have learned in my past couple years of undergraduate education. There may be errors, I'm not perfect but I will try my best to convey the most accurate information. Most of the information will be comprised from my personal notes or from a professor's notes. If I find that information is lacking on a topic or I don't understand it enough, the internet may prove to be useful.
